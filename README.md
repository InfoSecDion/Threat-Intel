<h1>Introduction</h1>

Their company had established a partnership with the Tryhackme.com platform to evaluate the technical skills of potential candidates in the field of threat intelligence.<br />

<h2>Task 1: Visit this image and answer the question below: </h2>

- In what city was the picture taken?


For this specific question, my approach was to determine the location where the picture was taken. To do this, I decided to narrow down my search to cities worldwide that began with the letters "c-a-r."
Steps:
1. I initiated a Google search to compile a list of cities that started with these three letters.
2. Upon discovering a website named "wordmom.com" through Google, I noticed a substantial number of cities with this initial sequence.
3. Faced with numerous possibilities and no clear answer, I further refined my search criteria by focusing on cities featuring both a prominent tower and iguanas. At this point, I sought assistance from ChatGPT to achieve a more succinct resolution.
4. ChatGPT suggested that the city I was likely looking for is "Cartagena." This turned out to be the correct answer when I entered it into the response box.
