<h1>Introduction</h1>
This lab functions as documentation of a technical exercise I undertook as part of my application for a threat intelligence analyst position. It was the most enjoyable experience I've had during any hiring process.

Their company had established a partnership with the Tryhackme.com platform to evaluate the technical skills of potential candidates in the field of threat intelligence.<br />

<h2>Guidelines/Instructions </h2>

- You have 24 hours to complete the challenge and answer as many questions correctly as possible.

- The points you earn by the end of this time will be taken into consideration for advancing to the next stage of the interview process.

<h2>Exercise Completion Process </h2>

- The exercise consists of 4 Obiectives that are at the core of the work we do at _____. You should do your best to answer all questions. Minimum score for advancement to the next stage of the interview process is 50% or 100 points. In addition, you must have answered at least 1 question from 3 of the Objectives.

- The test is open internet. All these questions are solvable and possible through research, creativity and attention to detail. You may use Google and other search engines as a resource to answer any of the questions.

<h2>Post Exercise Report</h2>

- After completion of the exercise a written report of 500-1000 words should be compiled in a document format
(PDF or Word). This report should include methodology on how each question of the exercise was completed.
Applicants should endeavor to explain not only what steps they took but their thought process on the completion of the exercise.

- It is recommended the report be well edited, complete, to the standards specified above, and provided as an attachment as outlined below.

<h2>Task 1: Visit this image and answer the question below: </h2>

- Q1. In what city was the picture taken?

For this specific question, my approach was to determine the location where the picture was taken. To do this, I decided to narrow down my search to cities worldwide that began with the letters "c-a-r."
Steps:
1. I initiated a Google search to compile a list of cities that started with these three letters.
2. Upon discovering a website named "wordmom.com" through Google, I noticed a substantial number of cities with this initial sequence.
3. Faced with numerous possibilities and no clear answer, I further refined my search criteria by focusing on cities featuring both a prominent tower and iguanas. At this point, I sought assistance from ChatGPT to achieve a more succinct resolution.
4. ChatGPT suggested that the city I was likely looking for is "Cartagena." This turned out to be the correct answer when I entered it into the response box.

<h1>Task 2: Visit this video and based on it answer the questions below: </h1>


Task 2 posed a greater challenge, especially in the last two of the six total questions. The most demanding part of this exercise, in my opinion, was the final two questions. Nevertheless, this experience was quite exciting as I delved into someone's Facebook profile at a level of detail I'd never explored before. It was genuinely intriguing to see how much revealing information someone might unknowingly share. In terms of my methodology, I knew I had to thoroughly examine the individual's profile since the answers were hidden there.

- Q1. What breed of dog does this individual who shot the video like?

I conducted an extensive search of the person's entire profile for pictures of dogs, and to my surprise, I found hundreds of Doberman pictures, which proved to be the correct answer for the first out of the six questions.

- Q2. Where was he employed from October 2018-February 2020?

Next, I looked into the individual's work history but couldn't find the necessary dates. Instead, I examined photos from that time frame and eventually discovered the right answer with a matching word count.

- Q3. In what city/state does he currently reside? Answer should be entered "City, State"

I focused on the person's current location as indicated on their profile, which led me to identify the city where they currently reside.

- Q4. On his Facebook profile, he has one family relationship listed. What is their name?

I examined the individual's family members listed on their profile and identified the correct answer in the form of a cousin.

- Q5. He had dinner with a friend on June 25th, 2014. What was the phone number of the restaurant he ate at?

Unfortunately, I couldn't find the answer to this question before my 24-hour time limit expired. I searched extensively for the phone numbers of Santa Grao on their website and Facebook, but none of them proved correct.

- Q6. What were the "Pratos do dia" at the restaurant tagged "Segunda":

Similarly, I was unable to find the answer to the sixth question. I had thought it was "crispy salmon" based on a photo from the individual's profile where they dined on June 25th, 2014, in Brazil. However, I couldn't confirm it in time, and I may need to consider alternative approaches to find the answer in the future.

<h2>Task 3: Visit this site and answer the questions below: Let's Play A Game </h2>

Upon entering the website, I noticed a lack of other prompts, which led me to believe that I needed to examine the website's source code to tackle this challenge. My approach was to pay attention to details that might be in plain sight but hidden to the untrained eye.


- Q1. What is the password?

To access the website's source code, I pressed "CTRL-U" on my keyboard, revealing the hidden password within the code.

- Q2. Answer this question with an MD5 hash of the password:

I conducted a Google search and came across miraclesalad.com, a website with an MD5 hash generator built-in. This tool allowed me to generate the MD5 hash for the password.

- Q3. Decipher the following statement: aHROcHM6L93d3cuZ2xvdmVyY29ud

I utilized the search function on dcode.fr to decrypt the statement, which ultimately helped me identify the correct website. I initially encountered unhelpful websites in my Google search but then remembered using dcode.fr for a previous lab, which ultimately led me to the correct answer.

- Q4. What is the Google Analytics ID of the answer from question 3?

This question posed a challenge for me as it was my first encounter with the term "Google Analytics ID." In the process, I contemplated creating an account but opted to explore YouTube for information. I discovered an app on the Apple Store called "source code" that enabled me to inspect website source codes and their respective languages, simplifying the identification of the JavaScript code containing the Google Analytics ID. This process was a learning experience and proved to be enjoyable.

<h2>Task 4: The dark web is a mysterious place to many but those in the Tower feel quite comfortable there.</h2>

- Q1. What is the web address of the CIA's dark web portal?

I initiated a Google search using the exact question phrasing, leading me to the correct answer on "wired.com."

- Q2. A TOR relay is also known as a ____.

I found the answer to this question by conducting a Google search.

- Q3. TOR stands for?

I recalled the answer to this question from my CompTIA Security+ studies, allowing me to answer it directly from my knowledge.

I completed 12/14 questions in total and finished at 86/100%, which did grant me advancement to the next stage of the interview process.

In summary, this experience was the most enjoyable I've ever had in any interview setting and served as an excellent introduction to OSINT. It encouraged me to think creatively and outside the box while also enhancing my knowledge. I would rate this technical interview experience 10/10.
